        <h1>Paint</h1>
    <p>   If you're thinking about painting a project, I'm here to help you find the paint you need at a reasonable price.
        Here's a few of our local paint stores: WalMart, Lowe's, and Sherwin-Williams. Each store provides a wide variety of paint types and colors.
        Depending on your project and your personal preference, depends on how much paint and what type of paint you will need. Some of the most common types of paints for household use are:
        flat, semi-gloss, and satin.</p>

          <p> Here is a table comparing the base prices between the different stores.</p>

          <p> *Prices also vary by brand and specificity.*</p>
